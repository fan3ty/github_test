Taichi Field Pool Module

Efficient pooling system for temporary Taichi fields to minimize GPU memory
allocation/deallocation overhead. Provides automatic field reuse and proper
memory management using the FieldsBuilder pattern.

The pool organizes fields by data type and shape, enabling O(1) lookup
performance and efficient field reuse across computations.

Supports 0D (scalar), 1D, and 2D fields with appropriate Taichi indexing:
- 0D fields: Single scalar values, no indexing required
- 1D fields: Linear arrays with ti.i indexing
- 2D fields: Matrices with ti.ij indexing
