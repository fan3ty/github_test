    Apply uniform block uplift to the topography.

    Adds vertical motion to all interior nodes (excluding boundary nodes
    that can drain out of the domain). This simulates tectonic uplift
    or other large-scale vertical motions.

    Args:
            z (ti.template): Topographic elevation field to be uplifted
            rate (ti.f32): Uplift rate in m/year (positive values = uplift)

    Note:
            Boundary nodes that can leave the domain are excluded from uplift
            to maintain consistent boundary conditions.

    Apply spatially-varying uplift without boundary checking.

    Applies variable uplift rates across the domain without excluding

    at domain edges where flow can exit.

            z (ti.template): Topographic elevation field to be uplifted
            rate (ti.template): Spatially-varying uplift rate field (m/year)

            Unlike block_uplift(), this function applies uplift to ALL nodes
            including boundary outlets, which may be desired for certain
            tectonic scenarios or boundary condition setups.
