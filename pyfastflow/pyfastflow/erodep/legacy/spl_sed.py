"""
Stream Power Law (SPL) erosion model implementation for landscape evolution.

This module implements the Stream Power Law erosion model using GPU-accelerated
Taichi kernels. The SPL model describes bedrock erosion rate as a function of
drainage area (discharge proxy) and local slope, following the equation:

E = K * A^m * S^n

where:
- E: erosion rate
- K: erodibility coefficient
- A: drainage area (or discharge)
- S: local slope
- m, n: empirical exponents

The implementation uses an implicit finite difference scheme for numerical
stability, allowing larger time steps while maintaining accuracy.

Key Features:
- Implicit SPL erosion with stability guarantees
- Block uplift implementation
- Integration with FastFlow routing system
- GPU-accelerated computation using Taichi
- Supports landscape evolution modeling

    Initialize fields for implicit Stream Power Law erosion computation.

    Sets up the implicit finite difference scheme for SPL erosion by computing

    Perform one iteration of implicit SPL erosion using receiver chains.

    This kernel implements the core iteration step of the implicit SPL solver.
    It follows drainage paths (receiver chains) to propagate erosion effects

    The algorithm performs parallel graph traversal along flow paths,
    updating elevations based on downstream erosion potential. Multiple

    Execute complete Stream Power Law erosion for one time step.

    This function orchestrates the full SPL erosion computation using an implicit
    finite difference scheme. It initializes erosion coefficients, then performs
    iterative updates to propagate erosion effects throughout the drainage network.

    The number of iterations is set to log2(N) where N is the total number of nodes,
    which ensures that erosion effects can propagate across the entire domain through
    the longest possible drainage paths.
