"""
Stream Power Law (SPL) erosion model implementation for landscape evolution.

This module implements the Stream Power Law erosion model using GPU-accelerated
Taichi kernels. The SPL model describes bedrock erosion rate as a function of
drainage area (discharge proxy) and local slope, following the equation:

E = K * A^m * S^n

where:
- E: erosion rate
- K: erodibility coefficient
- A: drainage area (or discharge)
- S: local slope
- m, n: empirical exponents

The implementation uses an implicit finite difference scheme for numerical
stability, allowing larger time steps while maintaining accuracy.

Key Features:
- Implicit SPL erosion with stability guarantees
- Block uplift implementation
- Integration with FastFlow routing system
- GPU-accelerated computation using Taichi
- Supports landscape evolution modeling
