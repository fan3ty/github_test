Flood LisFlood (LS) shallow water flow computation kernels.

Method implementation adapted from HAIL-CAESAR (https://github.com/dvalters/HAIL-CAESAR) to GPU
Method described in Bates et al. 2010: A simple inertial formulation of the shallow water equations for efficient two-dimensional flood inundation modelling

This module implements the LisFlood method for 2D shallow water flow simulation
using GPU-accelerated Taichi kernels. The LS method uses explicit time integration
with local time stepping for stability and efficiency.

Key Features:
- LisFlood time integration for shallow water equations
- Manning's friction implementation with stability checks
- Froude number limiting for numerical stability
- Discharge magnitude checks to prevent excessive flow
- 2D flow routing in both x and y directions

The implementation follows the LisFlood method principles:
1. Flow routing: Compute discharge in x and y directions
2. Depth update: Update water depths based on discharge divergence

Implementation Notes:
- Uses separate bed elevation (z) and water depth (h) fields instead of combined surface elevation
- Surface elevation is computed on-the-fly as z + h when needed for slope calculations
- This approach avoids floating-point precision issues with field synchronization

Constants used from constants module:
- HFLOW_THRESHOLD: Minimum flow depth threshold
- EDGESW: Boundary slope for edge conditions
- MANNING: Manning's roughness coefficient
- NY: Number of grid rows
- NX: Number of grid columns
- DT_HYDRO_LS: Time step for LisFlood hydro
- GRAVITY: Gravitational acceleration
- FROUDE_LIMIT: Maximum Froude number
